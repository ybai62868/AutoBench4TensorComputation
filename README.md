Benchmark scripts for Tensor Compilers and Popular Frameworks

## Background

Currently, there are lots of deep learning frameworks and compilers for the performance improvement. 

When I want to know the specific optimization difference on a backend, it is difficult to find a tool which can do the 
automatic generation of tensor programs and testing to make benchmarking easier.
